  "description": "Combines Shapley value-based rewards with strong punishment for adversarial behavior to create a fair and cooperative environment",
  "hypothesis": "With Shapley value rewards that fairly distribute benefits based on actual contribution, combined with strong punishment for adversarial behavior, we expect honest strategy to dominate quickly. The system should reach a stable equilibrium where honesty is the optimal strategy due to both fair rewards and strong disincentives for adversarial behavior."
